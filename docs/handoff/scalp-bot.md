# Handoff: Scalping bot (paper trading)

Started 2026-11-13. Fake money only: no exchange keys, no real orders.

## What it is
- `lib/paper/scalp/`: indicators, 4 methods (dip-buy Bollinger+RSI, breakout, trend pullback, VWAP snap-back),
  each long or long+short, plus a pessimistic fill simulator with risk controls
  (0.5% risk per trade, no leverage, fee/slippage filters, 2% daily loss stop, cool-down after 3 losses, 10% kill switch).
- `scripts/paper/download.ts`: 30 days of 1-minute Crypto.com candles into `.paper-data/` (not committed).
- `scripts/paper/research.ts`: walk-forward test (tune on 10 days across all 5 coins, trade the next 5 days), plus stress tests.
- `scripts/paper/live.ts`: forward paper test on live prices. `freeze` locks settings into `lib/paper/scalp/live-config.json`;
  `loop` runs every minute; no argument = one pass + report. Results replay from the frozen start time, so restarts don't change them.
- In the cloud sandbox run with `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` (the `empire-` environment allows api.crypto.com).

## Findings so far (30 days to 2026-11-13, a falling market: coins -15% to -24%)
- No method showed a reliable edge out of sample. Best were roughly break-even (profit factor 0.92–1.05).
- 1-minute scalping at 0.1% fees is structurally a loser: fees + slippage are bigger than a typical 1-minute stop.
- The cost filters were the biggest improvement: they cut out-of-sample losses from about -10–20% to about 0–2% per coin.

## Live test
- Daily summaries: `docs/handoff/daily/`. Second session's regime detector + 2-year/4h research: branch `claude/scalp-bot-daily-summary-fxn5vn` (merge, don't rebuild).
- Live spreads: BTC/ETH ~0%, SOL/XRP/DOGE ~0.01% median; XRP p90 ~0.08% (above the 0.02% slippage assumption).
- 25 sleeves × $400 (5 methods × 5 coins), clock started 2026-11-13 05:17 UTC. Report due ~24h later.
- **Do not** connect real money or exchange keys without a separate explicit decision from the owner.
